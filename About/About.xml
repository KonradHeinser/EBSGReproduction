Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Sometimes, things are born. They live, and then they stop. Forever. I've added a bunch of genes that let you alter the second half of that reference, and this mod seeks to help you with the first. It adds 8 new pregnancy speed genes that multiply pregnancy speed by 25%, 50%, 75%, 150%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, and 400%. It also includes 12 options for altering fertility by age, with two of them being gene versions of the mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982757714]Always Fertile[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985686809]Always Very Fertile[/url].

Note: If you're picking an aging fertility extension based on the lifespan factor of your xenotype, ranges are included in the gene descriptions. If your factor falls between two genes, pick whichever one of those two that you believe fits the xenotype more. 

Note for modders: If your lifespan factor is high enough to warrant a major or greater fertility extension, it is recommended to give those pawns special pawn kinds so you can have them spawn with age ranges that are much higher. The stranger in black is a good example of setting both in one pawn kind.
